# üî• DELIVERY CALCULATOR UI TEST REPORT üî•

## Test Environment
- **URL**: http://localhost:5180
- **Test Date**: 2025-08-10
- **Tester**: Gordon Ramsay of Software Engineering

## üß™ TEST EXECUTION RESULTS

### Test 1: Sydney Address (1 Macquarie Street, Sydney NSW 2000)
**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Google Places autocomplete should work
- ‚úÖ Zone should be detected as "Eastern"
- ‚úÖ Available days should show Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday
- ‚úÖ Two-person option should appear for Tue/Wed

**Actual Result:** üî¥ **FAILED**
- **Issue**: Zone detection API is failing (`/api/zones?postcode=2000` returns error)
- **Root Cause**: Database connection unavailable, fallback to sydney-zones.json not working properly
- **Console Error**: "Failed to fetch zone data"
- **Impact**: No zone-based delivery days shown, no two-person option available

---

### Test 2: Corridor Postcode (123 Main St, Coffs Harbour NSW 2450)
**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Corridor should be detected
- ‚úÖ Should show $190 fixed price
- ‚úÖ No zone days should be shown

**Actual Result:** üü° **PARTIALLY WORKING**
- **Issue**: CSV files exist but API returns empty arrays
- **Root Cause**: Postcodes not loading from CSV files correctly
- **Console Log**: "CSV file not found, returning empty array" (but files DO exist!)
- **Impact**: Corridor detection failing, falling back to distance-based pricing

---

### Test 3: Melbourne Address (1 Collins Street, Melbourne VIC 3000)
**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Melbourne should be detected correctly
- ‚úÖ Should show Shepherds Transport info
- ‚úÖ No zone system applied

**Actual Result:** üü° **PARTIALLY WORKING**
- **Expected**: Should detect Melbourne from VIC state code
- **Note**: Google Maps distance calculation likely working but Shepherds Transport messaging needs verification

---

### Test 4: Brisbane Address (100 Queen Street, Brisbane QLD 4000)
**Expected Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Brisbane should be detected correctly
- ‚úÖ Distance-based pricing should apply
- ‚úÖ No zone system (Brisbane doesn't have zones)

**Actual Result:** üü° **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
- **Expected**: Should calculate from Brisbane warehouse
- **Note**: Needs manual UI verification

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **Zone Detection Completely Broken**
```javascript
// API returns: {"success": false, "error": "Failed to fetch zone data"}
// But sydney-zones.json EXISTS with proper data!
```

### 2. **CSV File Loading Failure**
```javascript
// Console shows: "CSV file not found, returning empty array"
// But files exist at:
// - /public/sydney-brisbane-corridor.csv ‚úÖ
// - /public/sydney-melbourne-corridor.csv ‚úÖ
```

### 3. **Database Fallback Not Working**
```javascript
// Console: "Database unavailable, falling back to CSV files"
// But fallback is not actually reading the CSV files!
```

---

## üîß REQUIRED FIXES

### Priority 1: Fix Zone Detection
The zone service needs to properly read from `sydney-zones.json` when database is unavailable.

### Priority 2: Fix CSV Loading
The corridor postcode service is not finding CSV files that clearly exist in `/public`.

### Priority 3: Add Error Handling
When zone/corridor detection fails, app should gracefully fall back to basic distance calculation.

## üç≥ GORDON'S VERDICT

**THIS DELIVERY CALCULATOR IS BLOODY RAW!** 

The core functionality is broken because:
1. Zone detection API is returning errors instead of reading the JSON file
2. CSV files exist but aren't being loaded properly
3. No proper error handling when services fail

The app is running but key features are completely non-functional. This needs immediate fixing before any customer can use it!
